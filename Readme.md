**.gitignore rationale:** I ignore build outputs, dependency folders, and local env/OS files to keep the repo clean.

## Branch Usage

- **author/idea-sprint**: Used for brainstorming and developing new ideas or features. This branch is for early drafts and experiments before they are finalized.
- **editor/review**: Used for reviewing and refining content or code from the author branch. Changes here are checked, tested, and prepared for merging into the main branch.
