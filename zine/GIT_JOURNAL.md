I learned disciplined Git: atomic commits with clear subjects, issue-closing PRs, and branching for draft vs review. I fixed two mistakesâ€”accidentally tracking `.DS_Store` and attempting to delete an unmerged branch. `git stash` and a repo/global `.gitignore` saved me, and I cleanly resolved merge conflict in `zine/intro.md`.
